CConfig
=======

This is a config file parser I wrote a few years ago. It fit a particular use
case of mine where I wanted to have a vocabulary file with some definitions and
parse different types of data from a somewhat unconventional configuration file.

Like a few other of my projects, the source is mixed in with the header which is
probably a bad idea. I think the implementation is interesting, though. There is
no documentation but you can take a look at `Main.cpp` to see how to use it.
